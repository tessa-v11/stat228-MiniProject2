# Stat228-MiniProject2

This repository contains my Stat228 mini project where I created a tutorial on wrangling data using R.

## Overview

In this mini-project, you will be writing a tutorial on data wrangling in R. Your goal is to effectively communicate the entire data wrangling and cleaning process in the context of a real dataset. While the goal of this project is to convey how one may manipulate/organize data, the chosen dataset should still provide context in the sense that the tutorial flows from beginning to end, and each step is well-motivated. 
- Target audience: someone who is familiar with R, but new to data wrangling, e.g., a friend who hasn’t taken STAT228 or a potential employer
    - Writing for a beginner might feel challenging, but that’s the point!
    - Teaching someone else is one of the best ways to show you really understand something.
    - If you can explain your process clearly and simply, it means you truly get it — and that’s exactly what this project is about
 
## What to include
- Introduction: text that introduces data wrangling and the dataset that you’ll use
- Data wrangling process with exercises and data visualizations:
    - text, code, and data visualizations that walk through the data wrangling process
    - You do not have to cover every function covered in class; however the tutorial should be more complex that a laundry list of of mutate()s and filter()s calls
    - Create something that is insightful and well-crafted.
- Conclusion: text summarizing the data wrangling process and key takeaways
